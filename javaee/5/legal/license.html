fully-paid, non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide, limited license<br>
(without the right to sublicense), under Sun's applicable intellectual<br>
property rights to view, download, use and reproduce the Specification<br>

implement any portion(s) of the Specification, and (ii) discussing the<br>
Specification with any third party; and (iii) excerpting brief portions<br>
of the Specification in oral or written communications which discuss the<br>

<br>
2. _License for the Distribution of Compliant Implementations_. Sun also<br>
grants you a perpetual, non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide,<br>
fully paid-up, royalty free, limited license (without the right to<br>
sublicense) under any applicable copyrights or, subject to the<br>
provisions of subsection 4 below, patent rights it may have covering the<br>
Specification to create and/or distribute an Independent Implementation<br>
of the Specification that: (a) fully implements the Specification<br>
including all its required interfaces and functionality; (b) does not<br>
modify, subset, superset or otherwise extend the Licensor Name Space, or<br>
include any public or protected packages, classes, Java interfaces,<br>
fields or methods within the Licensor Name Space other than those<br>
required/authorized by the Specification or Specifications being<br>
implemented; and (c) passes the Technology Compatibility Kit (including<br>
satisfying the requirements of the applicable TCK Users Guide) for such<br>
Specification ("Compliant Implementation"). In addition, the foregoing<br>
license is expressly conditioned on your not acting outside its scope.<br>
No license is granted hereunder for any other purpose (including, for<br>
example, modifying the Specification, other than to the extent of your<br>
fair use rights, or distributing the Specification to third parties).<br>

from the previous paragraph or any other particular "pass through"<br>
requirements in any license You grant concerning the use of your<br>
Independent Implementation or products derived from it. However, except<br>
with respect to Independent Implementations (and products derived from<br>
them) that satisfy limitations (a)-(c) from the previous paragraph, You<br>
may neither: (a) grant or otherwise pass through to your licensees any<br>
licenses under Sun's applicable intellectual property rights; nor (b)<br>
authorize your licensees to make any claims concerning their<br>
implementation's compliance with the Specification in question.<br>
<br>
<br>
4. _Reciprocity Concerning Patent Licenses_.<br>
<br>
<br>
a. With respect to any patent claims covered by the license granted<br>
under subparagraph 2 above that would be infringed by all technically<br>
feasible implementations of the Specification, such license is<br>
conditioned upon your offering on fair, reasonable and<br>
non-discriminatory terms, to any party seeking it from You, a perpetual,<br>
non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide license under Your patent<br>
rights which are or would be infringed by all technically feasible<br>
implementations of the Specification to develop, distribute and use a<br>
Compliant Implementation.<br>
<br>
<br>
b With respect to any patent claims owned by Sun and covered by the<br>
license granted under subparagraph 2, whether or not their infringement<br>
can be avoided in a technically feasible manner when implementing the<br>
Specification, such license shall terminate with respect to such claims<br>
if You initiate a claim against Sun that it has, in the course of<br>
performing its responsibilities as the Specification Lead, induced any<br>
other entity to infringe Your patent rights.<br>
<br>
<br>
c Also with respect to any patent claims owned by Sun and covered by the<br>
license granted under subparagraph 2 above, where the infringement of<br>
such claims can be avoided in a technically feasible manner when<br>
implementing the Specification such license, with respect to such<br>
claims, shall terminate if You initiate a claim against Sun that its<br>
making, having made, using, offering to sell, selling or importing a<br>
Compliant Implementation infringes Your patent rights.<br>
<br>
<br>
5. _Definitions_. For the purposes of this Agreement: "Independent<br>
Implementation" shall mean an implementation of the Specification that<br>
neither derives from any of Sun's source code or binary code materials<br>
nor, except with an appropriate and separate license from Sun, includes<br>
any of Sun's source code or binary code materials; "Licensor Name Space"<br>
shall mean the public class or interface declarations whose names begin<br>
with "java", "javax", "com.sun" or their equivalents in any subsequent<br>
naming convention adopted by Sun through the Java Community Process, or<br>
any recognized successors or replacements thereof; and "Technology<br>
Compatibility Kit" or "TCK" shall mean the test suite and accompanying<br>
TCK User's Guide provided by Sun which corresponds to the Specification<br>
and that was available either (i) from Sun's 120 days before the first<br>
release of Your Independent Implementation that allows its use for<br>
commercial purposes, or (ii) more recently than 120 days from such<br>
release but against which You elect to test Your implementation of the<br>
Specification.<br>
<br>
<br>
This Agreement will terminate immediately without notice from Sun if you<br>
breach the Agreement or act outside the scope of the licenses granted
above.<br>
