                  </p>
                  <p>This topic describes troubleshooting techniques for the following Java SE dsktop technologies:</p>
                  <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                     <li>
                        <p><span class="bold">Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT)</span> provides a set of application programming interfaces (APIs) for constructing graphical user interface (GUI) components such as menus, buttons, text fields, dialog boxes, checkboxes, and for handling user input through those components. In addition, AWT allows for rendering of simple shapes such as ovals and polygons and enables developers to control the interface layout and fonts used by their applications. It also includes data transfer classes (including drag and drop) that allow cut and paste through the native platform clipboard.
                        </p>
                        <p>The classes of this API are at the bottom of the software stack (closest to the underlying operating and desktop system).</p>
                        <p>AWT also provides a set of heavyweight components.</p>
                        <p>Purely AWT applications are usually not related to Swing. If an AWT application does custom rendering, it uses Java 2D.</p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p><span class="bold">Java 2D</span> is a set of classes for advanced 2D graphics and imaging. It encompasses line art, text, and images in a single comprehensive model. The API provides extensive support for image compositing and alpha channel images, a set of classes to provide accurate color space definition and conversion, and a rich set of display-oriented imaging operators. These classes are provided as additions to the <code class="codeph">java.awt</code> and <code class="codeph">java.awt.image</code> packages. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Like AWT, Java 2D is also at the bottom of the software stack (closest to the underlying operating and desktop system).</p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p><span class="bold">Swing</span> provides a comprehensive set of GUI components and services which enables the development of commercial-quality desktop and Internet/Intranet applications.
                        </p>
                        <p>Swing is built on top of many of the other Java SE Desktop technologies, including AWT, Java2D and Internationalization. In most cases the Swing high-level components are recommended instead of those in AWT. However, there are many APIs in AWT that are important to understand when programming in Swing.</p>
                        <p>Since Swing is a lightweight toolkit, it has very little interaction with the native platform. Swing uses Java 2D for rendering, and AWT provides creation and manipulation of top-level components, such as Windows, Frames, and Dialogs.</p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p><span class="bold">Internationalization</span> is the process of designing software so that it can be adapted (localized) to various languages and regions easily, cost-effectively, and in particular without engineering changes to the software. <strong class="term">Localization</strong> is performed by simply adding locale-specific components, such as translated text, data describing locale-specific behavior, fonts, and input methods.
                        </p>
                        <p>In Java SE, internationalization support is fully integrated into the classes and packages that provide language-dependent or culture-dependent functionality.</p>
                        <p>To know more about internationalization APIs and features of Java SE, see <a href="https://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/java/javase/11/troubleshoot&amp;id=JSINT-GUID-1CB4B574-44E2-49E3-ACB4-AE6EF83A7F86" target="_blank">Internationalization documentation</a>.
                        </p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p><span class="bold">Java Sound</span> provides low-level support for audio operations such as audio playback and capture (recording), mixing, musical instrument digital interface (MIDI) sequencing, and MIDI synthesis in an extensible, flexible framework. This API is supported by an efficient sound engine which guarantees high-quality audio mixing and MIDI synthesis capabilities for the platform.
                        </p>
                     </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>The better you understand the relationships between these technologies, the more quickly you can pinpoint the area your problem falls into.</p>

                  <p>First of all, take a moment to categorize the problem you are experiencing. This will help you to identify the specific area of the problem, find the cause, and ultimately determine a solution or a workaround.</p>

                     <p>The default name of the error log file is hs_err_<span class="variable" translate="no">pid</span>.log where <span class="variable" translate="no">pid</span> is the process identifier (PID) of the process that crashed.

                     <p>A line near the top of the header section indicates the library where the error occurred. The following example shows that the crash was related to the AWT library.</p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>...
# Java VM: Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (1.6.0-beta2-b76 mixed mode, sharing)
# Problematic frame:
# C  [awt.dll+0x123456]
...
</code></pre><p>If the crash occurred in the Java Native Interface (JNI), it was likely to have been caused by the desktop libraries. A crash in a native library typically means a problem in Java 2D or AWT, because Swing does not have much native code. The small amount of native code in Swing is then concerned with the native look and feel, and if your application is using native look and feel, then the crash may be related to this area.</p>
                     <p>The error log usually shows the exact library where the crash occurred, and this can give you a good idea of the cause. Crashes in libraries which are not part of the Java Development Kit (JDK) usually indicate problems with the environment, for example, bad video drivers or desktop managers.</p>

                     <p>Performance problems are harder to diagnose because you generally do not have as much information.</p>
                     <p>First, you must determine which technology has the problem. For example, rendering performance problems are probably in Java 2D, and responsiveness issues can be Swing-related.</p>
                     <p>Performance-related problems can be divided into the following categories:</p>
                     <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                        <li>

                           <p>How fast does the application complete the task it is designed to perform? For example, if the application computes something, how long does it take to finish the computations? In the case of a game, is the frame rate acceptable, and does the animation look smooth?</p>

                     <p>In addition to crashes, various behavior-related problems can occur. Some of these problems are listed below. Their descriptions can guide you to the Java SE Desktop technology to troubleshoot.</p>

                           <p><span class="bold">Rendering and repainting issues</span> indicate a problem in Java 2D or in Swing. For example, the application’s appearance is incorrect after a repaint that was caused by another application being dragged over it. Other examples are incorrect font, wrong colors, scrolling, damaging the application's frame by dragging another window over it, and updating a damaged area.
                           </p>
                           <p>A quick test is the following: If the problem is reproducible on a different platform (for example, the problem was originally seen on Windows, and it is also present on Oracle Solaris or Linux), it is very likely to be a Swing <code class="codeph">PaintManager</code> problem.
                           </p>
                           <p>For the ways to change the Java 2D rendering pipelines with some flags, see <a href="java-2d.html#GUID-63FAD092-E3E7-416D-9CA3-25BBACFC46E9" title="Information and guidance for troubleshooting some of the most common issues that might be found in the Java 2D API.">Java 2D</a>. This can also help determine if the problem is related to Java 2D or to Swing.
                           </p>
                           <p>Multiscreen-related repainting issues belong to Java 2D (for example, repainting problems when moving a window from one screen to another, or other unusual behavior caused by the interaction with a non-default screen device).</p>

                           <p><span class="bold">Issues related to desktop interaction</span> indicate a problem in AWT. Some examples of such issues occur when moving, resizing, minimizing and maximizing windows, handling focus, enumerating multiple screens, using modality, interacting with the notification area (system tray), and viewing splash screens.

                           <p><span class="bold">Text-rendering issues</span> in AWT applications might be a problem in font properties or in internationalization.
                           </p>
                           <p>However, if your application is purely AWT, text rendering problems might also be caused by Java 2D. On Oracle Solaris or Linux, text rendering is performed by Java 2D.</p>
                           <p>Text rendering in Swing is performed by Java 2D. Therefore, if your application uses Swing and you have text rendering problems (such as missing glyphs, incorrect rendering of glyphs, incorrect spacing between lines or characters, bad quality of font rendering), then the problem is likely to be in Java 2D.</p>
