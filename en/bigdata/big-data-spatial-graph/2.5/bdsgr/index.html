            <section>
                <div>The RESTful Web Services Spatial API is composed of the Vector Hadoop API, which uses the java Spatial Hadoop Java API, and the Vector Spark API, which uses the Spatial Spark Java API. The RESTful Web Services Spatial APIs contains services to spatially filter records and a subset of the functions available in the Hadoop and Spark java APIs. The record filtering examples show how to consume the service response with the Map API, and they show the service response on a map. The binning and clustering results can be also consumed by the Map API for display.</div>
