<div>
<p>A deployment rule set enables enterprises to continue using legacy business applications in an environment of ever-tightening application security policies. You can use a deployment rule set to manage which web-based Java applications, such as Java applets or Java Web Start applications, are allowed to run in an enterprise. You can also use a deployment rule set to control the version of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) that is used for an application. The <span>Advanced Management Console</span> provides administrators with a tool for creating and managing deployment rules sets, which can then be distributed throughout the enterprise.</p>
<p>Deployment rule sets contain deployment rules. These rules are used in the deployment process to determine if a browser-based Java application is allowed to run, if the application is automatically blocked, or if default processing is used. Applications are compared to the rules based on criteria such as location, title, JAR file checksum, and certificate used to sign the application. Rules are compared in the order in which they appear in the rule set. The first rule that an application matches determines the action taken for that application.</p>
<p>Although multiple rule sets can be defined, only one rule set can be active on a user's system. That rule set must be a signed JAR file. The export feature of the in the <span class="bold">Rule Sets</span> tab generates the necessary JAR file. If JAR signing is enabled, then signing is done as part of the export process; otherwise, the JAR file must be signed manually. After the JAR file is signed, it must be imported into the <span>Advanced Management Console</span> to be available for distribution. See <a href="rules-and-rule-set-management.htm#GUID-1560B06C-81D8-4A32-9826-FFF12B9009DA" title="When you have a deployment rule set ready for production, you can export that rule set and create the file that can be distributed to desktops. The file is signed if the tool is configured to supporting signing the rule set as part of the export process.">Exporting a Rule Set</a>. In the Rule Sets tab, you can also set a rule set as the default deployment rule set. See <a href="rules-and-rule-set-management.htm#GUID-A2DBEA56-9207-444E-BB56-EEB5CD0A9538" title="In the Rule Sets tab of the Advanced Management Console, you can set a rule set as the default deployment rule set. If a default deployment rule set exists, then Advanced Management Console automatically deploys that default rule set to target systems during the Advanced Management Console agent registration.">Setting Default Deployment Rule Set</a>,</p>

<p>Sign the rule set externally after you have exported it.
